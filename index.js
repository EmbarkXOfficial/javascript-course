Assignment Operators:

   - Subtraction assignment (-=)
   - Multiplication assignment (*=)
   - Division assignment (/=)
*/

// Assignment (=)
let a = 5;
console.log("a:", a);

// Addition assignment (+=)
let b = 10;
// b = b + 3;
b += 3; // Equivalent to: b = b + 3;
console.log("b:", b);


// Subtraction assignment (-=)
let c = 15;
// c = c - 5;
c -= 5; // Equivalent to: c = c - 5;
console.log("c:", c); // Output: 10


// Multiplication assignment (*=)
let d = 6;
// d = d * 2;
d *= 2; // Equivalent to: d = d * 2;
console.log("d:", d); // Output: 12



// Division assignment (/=)
let e = 20;
e /= 4; // Equivalent to: e = e / 4;
console.log("e:", e); // Output: 5
